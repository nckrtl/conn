 * "<app name> Safe Storage", where the name is the one Electron has at startup:
 * the `name` in the app's package.json when packaged ("t3code"), and Electron's
 * own default in development ("Electron"). A rename that leaves those alone keeps
 * the key, and nothing here runs. If the key does change, secrets the old key
 * encrypted no longer decrypt. This module reads the old key from the keychain,
 * decrypts them in Node and encrypts them again with the new key.
